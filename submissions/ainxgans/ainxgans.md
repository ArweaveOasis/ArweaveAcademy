**Introduce Yourself**
Hello, everyone!
My name is Ainxgans, and I’m thrilled to be part of this vibrant cryptocurrency community.
I’ve been actively involved in the crypto space since 2017, focusing on crypto trading, DeFi, and NFTs. My journey started with learning about Bitcoin and exploring smart contracts on Ethereum, and it has been an exciting ride ever since.

Currently, I’m passionate about Layer-2 scaling solutions, decentralized governance, and the potential of Web3.

Best regards,
Ainxgans
